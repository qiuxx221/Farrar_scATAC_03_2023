This project is mostly focusing on motifs and co-accessbility between peaks. The goal of Hrishi is to find out TFs that protentially drives the divergence of different T cell types
All final files are stored in directory: 
/home/farrarm/shared/riss/qiuxx221/hrishi_scatac032023/cellranger_aggr/Farrar_057_TCR_groupinfo/outs

What has been done: 
1. 4 scATAC lib integration of 3 time points and 1 naive cell population. This naive cell population was later discarded because it is very distinic from T cells
2. UMAP on day 9, 13, and day 17 T cells


3. Identified differential aceesible peaks between clusters by time point. Hrishi and Mike are very interested in day 9 cluster 1 and 4, day 13 cluster 1,2,5, and day 17 cluster 1,2,5
a) DAP with highlight with a universal range for the coverage plot : 2023_March_scATAC_Farrar_scATAC_figure_universal_gene_range.Rmd
b) compute all the coaccessibility on selected genes from Hrishi:

4. Motifs enrichment was done for selected contrast

b) Motifs activity computed by chromvar: 2023_March_scATAC_Farrar_motif_analysis_chromvar_selected_motifs.Rmd

5. circero co-accessibility was calcuated for peaks
a) all filtered links (0.3)

Cell_day13_cluster_5_links_0.3.RDS

Cell_day9_cluster_1_links_0.3.RDS
Cell_day9_cluster_4_links_0.3.RDS

6. an approach of identify peaks with high co-accessibility, and have motifs, and also are DAP was analyzed, Rmarkdown file is named:
